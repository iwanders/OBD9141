T3_ILI9341_display
==================

This example is a completed project, it uses an ILI9341 (320x240 pixel) tft screen to display various PID values. For
every PID value a seperate polling interval can be used. A [Teensy 3.2][teensy3] was used in this project, which allows
using the the optimized [Teensy 3 library][9341_t3] to quickly draw on the ILI9341 screen.

The screen's image looks something like:
